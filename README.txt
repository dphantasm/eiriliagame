Eirilia Game Proof of Concept by Sara Justiniano Maldonado

"Eirilia" is a dungeon-crawling game inspired by old-school role-playing games like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest. It features an overhead camera tracking the player, locked doors and keys that can be collected to open them, and a turn-based battle system in which the player fights against enemies. Battles are started via "random encounters", controlled by a hidden timer. In areas where random encounters can happen, the "DANGER" meter at the top of the screen will show red. 

In battle, the game is controlled via the mouse. The player takes one action, then the enemies act, then the player may act again. Until one side is killed, the battle will continue in this way. If the player wins, they will return to the overworld and collect the experience points from the enemy. In the final game, once enough experience points are collected, the player will level up and become strong.
